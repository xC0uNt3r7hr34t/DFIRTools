This tool is meant to quickly identify mismatches in the Client IP and Source IP addresses that is indicative of session hijacking.

It is first recommended to combine all the ns.log files into one file and remove all lines that do not contain “SSLVPN TCPCONNSTAT”. 

cat ns.log* | grep "SSLVPN TCPCONNSTAT" | sort > nslog-comb 

Now that we have a combined log file we can use it as input for our tool. Run the tool and specify the log file as an argument to be used for input.

ipjack.sh nslog-comb

Review the output to verify against the rest of the log file any matches that are identified.
